# Week 7

# Fix our email!
So you probably noticed that our email repo is kinda of a crazy mess, and that writing tables can be a pain in the ass. Ian found this amazing library called [Inky](https://foundation.zurb.com/emails/docs/inky.html) a little while back but we haven't had the time to experiment and see if it's a viable option.


## Goals
This week is going to build on some of the things you learned the past couple weeks.

- Create a Github repo for your experimentations
- Choose and email from this [Sketch file](http://emailpush.mileiq.netdna-cdn.com/dist-files/emails-hao.sketch) to code using Inky (You have two options a responsive, and a text heavy one)
- Utilize partials (reusable modules) as much as possible
- Report back on if you think Inky is a good solution for us

### Your deliverable will be a detailed Readme file that includes:
- A report of your experience using Inky
- Directions for Ian and I to run your code
- A list of problems you've run into that make Inky difficult
- A recommendation on if we should purse this tool.


### Food for thought
- How difficult is it to translate the existing templates to Inky?
- Are there any competitors that would work better for us?
