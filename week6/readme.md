# Week 6

## Command Line
As you started to realize, feeling comfortable around the Command Line is super helpful in development. Let's start the week learning commands and how to navigate your way through the file system.

### COMMAND LINE MYSTERY
One of the ways that I learned about the command line was playing this mystery game where you have to navigate a bunch of files to find clues.

Start by moving to your desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`

Next clone the game: `git clone https://github.com/veltman/clmystery.git`

Once it's downloaded change directory into the game: `cd clmystery`

Now, run `cat instructions` to read about how to play!
