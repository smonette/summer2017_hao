# Week 6

## 1. Finish your project
Take the beginning of the week to finish anything on your project from last week

## 2. Learn some Command Line
As you started to realize, feeling comfortable around the Command Line is super helpful in development. Let's start the week learning commands and how to navigate your way through the file system.

### Review

* [Command Line Cheatsheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/)

### COMMAND LINE MYSTERY
One of the ways that I learned about the command line was playing this mystery game where you have to navigate a bunch of files to find clues.

Start by moving to your desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`

Next clone the game: `git clone https://github.com/veltman/clmystery.git`

Once it's downloaded change directory into the game: `cd clmystery`

Now, run `cat instructions` to read about how to play!

## 3. Review any feedback on your project
First off, GOOD JOB! This was really good work, and I'm excited to see how you jumped into learning Sass and getting familiar with Github pages.

If you go to the issues tab of your project, you'll see some comments and feedback that I've left for you. There's not too much but they're fixes that are good best practices. (And can really give you that polish that'll impress future employers)
