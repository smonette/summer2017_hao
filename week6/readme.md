# Week 6

## Command Line
As you started to realize last week, the Command Line is super useful when you're writing code. Let's spend this week getting more comfortable with commands and navigating your way through the file system.

### COMMAND LINE MYSTERY
One of the ways that I learned about the command line was playing this mystery game where you have to navigate a bunch of files to find clues.

Start by moving to your desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`

Next clone the game: `git clone https://github.com/veltman/clmystery.git`

Once it's downloaded change directory into the game: `cd clmystery`

Now, run `cat instructions` to read about how to play!
