# Welcome Hao!

We're happy to have you joining us this summer! 

Our hope is that you can leave MileIQ this summer feeling like a pro at HTML and CSS, and have some great projects to share in future. Your time is going to be a blend of marketing tasks, research, and open-ended projects where you can explore front-end dev on your own.



## Goals

### By the end of summer 2017 our hope is that you will:

  * Feel confident and capable as an HTML/CSS developer.
  * Feel comfortable working in a collaborative version control process. (Github)
  * Be excited to experiment with new tech.
  * Be confident with email coding best practices.
  * Understand the lifecycle of a project from kickoff to launch.
  * Have real-world work to show in future interviews.


We're excited to have you! [Let's get started!](week1)
