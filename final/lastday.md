# Last Day

I can't believe it's your last day! Thank you for your amazing work this summer. It's be awesome having you here to help out the team, and getting to know you as a person. You last day is mostly your final, but here's some things to do your last morning.

1. Make sure all your code is backed up to the company Github

2. Make sure you take some screen caps of your work for your portfolio

3. Take samples of code you're proud of to add to your own "library" of snippets.

4. Run through your presentaion a couple times. Ask a friend or someone on the team to watch and give you feedback.

5. Raid the kitchen for Yellowstone snacks
