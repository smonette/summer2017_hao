# Final Project

OMG HAO! :sparkles: It's almost the end of summer! You've done an amazing job learning HTML, Sass, exploring new tools, and shipping *REAL* emails to MileIQ customers. We're all really proud of your progress, and enjoyed getting to know you.

Like I said at the beginning, I want you to leave this internship feeling prepared to get your next one. For your final project and presentation we want you to practice your job interviewing skills.


## Goals
1. Feel confident talking about your work
2. Feel more comfortable talking in front of a group
3. Get exposure to whiteboarding/technical interview questions

# Coding

## Resume site
Create a simple web site that talks about your work experience, projects, school etc. It doesn't have to be anything fancy, but something presentable you should link to a future employer. Since you're a professional web developer now, this page should be:

* fully responsive.

* built with Sass.

* stored in a Github repo, with a well-written README.

* visible on a live url.

* spellchecked.



## Review & refine past work
Go back into your projects from this summer and choose a couple things to improve. This could be an email that you liked, or your coded prototype. Take some time to make them perfect, and ready to be presented to the marketing team (or your next employer!)

* Does the code respond well?

* Does the design break down anywhere?

# Final Presentation

## Part 1: Technical Interview

You, Ian and I will all get into a room and do a mock interview. We'll ask you some technical questions you might face in a real interview, and at least one whiteboarding exercise.

Food for thought:

* It's always ok to say "I don't know", but suggest how you might figure out the answer.

* Whiteboarding exercises are meant to see how you think about a problem. Always think out loud as you write on the board. (Google for "technical whiteboard interviews")

* Feel free to ask for clarification, or more detail



## Part 2: Team Show & Tell

I'd like for you to share the marketing team the amazing work you've done at MileIQ.

I'll let you choose the agenda and format for this presentation but I'd like it to answer the following questions:

* What's your background?

* Where do you go to your school? 

* What are you studying?

* What are your interests/passions?

* What did you learn during your internship?



Some ideas/inspiration:

* A "Before and After Inky" presentation of our email system. Show everyone what the email code used to look like, and how it looks now. It doesn't need to be too technical, and just showing the cleaner system will get the point across. Maybe demo making a change in both systems. 

* A "portfolio" presentation. Show us an email, project, or your resume site and explain the process of building it. Challenges, things your learned. This format coud be just a bunch of open tabs in Chrome.

* Build a more traditional Powerpoint that explains your story and "sells" your skillset.

* A "retrospective" Powerpoint on your time here. What went well, what you learned, what could have been better.



## Part 3: Happy Hour
