# Week 1

Week 1 is a great time to get acclimated to the office, do some research, and get ready to get started.

## 1. Set up your machine

1. Download a text editor. I use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), but you should use whatever you feel comfortable in. 
2. Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (It takes a long time, so don't be worried if it seems unreasonably long.)
3. Install [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/). This will also install npm!
4. Download [Slack](https://slack.com/). Slack is our primary way of chatting at work!

## 2. Get Comfortable at 1355 Market
  * Fo IT Help, talk to Joey Santana: v-alsant@microsoft.com
