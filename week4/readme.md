# Week 4

## YAY FUN PROJECT! :sparkles:
First off, thanks so much for bearing with me the past few weeks. It's been a crazy push to relaunch day and I appreciate you rolling with the chaos, and helping Ian on those emailsâ€”you're a lifesaver! 

This week we have a fun dev exercise. Your task is to turn this [sketch file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tsua2ouau8blqsn/Web_Dev_Exercise.sketch?dl=0) into a working HTML/Sass prototype! Since things are quieting down, you should have all thbe time you need to focus on building something your excited about.

### Goals
This is a project for you to explore front-end development, and get familiar with the sort of problems you'd be asked in a job interview. You can use whatever tools you want, but I want to see the following:

- A Github repo for your project
- Meaningful commit messages
- A coded prototype, based on a Sketch file
- Sass as a CSS pre-processor 
- Your prototype deployed to a live url


## Final Deliverables
- Slack me the URL to your repo
- Slack me the URL to your site

### Not sure where to start?
1. Ask Ian can buy you a Sketch subscription with his Microsoft AMEX.
2. Read the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) documentation
3. Search for how to compile your Sass files into CSS
4. Is there a base template for HTML + Sass projects?
5. Is there a way to deploy your site in Github?
6. Review Git [best practices](https://github.com/smonette/fed-resources#git)


### Things to consider
- What choices can you make that will allow this to work on all devices?
- How is Sass different than CSS? And, how can you use this functionality to make coding easier?
